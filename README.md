# Gender Classification using Decision Tree

This is a simple **machine learning project** using the **DecisionTreeClassifier** from `scikit-learn` to predict gender based on **height, weight, and shoe size**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses a **Decision Tree** model to classify gender.
- Takes input features: **[height, weight, shoe size]**.
- Trains the model with a small dataset.
- Makes predictions based on new input values.

## 📂 Files

- `gender_classification.py` - Contains the main code for training and predicting.
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install `scikit-learn`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Script
Execute the Python file:

```bash
python gender_classification.py
```

### 3️⃣ Example Output
If you input `[190, 70, 43]`, the model may predict:

```
['male']
```

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset for better accuracy.
- Use more advanced models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.
- Implement a web or GUI interface for user input.
